# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

Sourcify is an open-source smart contract verification service for Ethereum and compatible blockchains. The repository is a monorepo containing:

- **services/server**: HTTP API server for contract verification with PostgreSQL database backend
- **services/monitor**: Chain monitoring service that automatically detects new contracts and submits them for verification
- **services/database**: PostgreSQL database schema, migrations, and related scripts using dbmate
- **packages/lib-sourcify**: Core verification library for contract validation, compilation, and verification
- **packages/bytecode-utils**: Library for extracting metadata from bytecode
- **packages/compilers**: Wrapper around Solidity and Vyper compilers
- **packages/compilers-types**: TypeScript types for compilers

## Common Commands

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages and services
npx lerna run build

# Clean build (removes node_modules and rebuilds everything)
npm run build:clean

# Build specific package/service
cd services/server && npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests across all packages/services
npm run lerna-test

# Run server tests with database setup
cd services/server && npm run test-local

# Run specific test suite:
# Server unit tests
cd services/server && npm run test:unit
# Server integration tests
cd services/server && npm run test-local
# Server chain tests
cd services/server && npm run test:chains


# Run lib-sourcify tests
cd packages/lib-sourcify && npm test
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Lint all packages/services
npm run lerna-lint

# Lint specific service
cd services/server && npm run check

# Fix linting issues
npm run lerna-fix

# Fix specific service
cd services/server && npm run fix
```

### Database Operations

IMPORTANT: Double check the `.env` file in `services/database` and ask for approval before running any `npm run migrate` commands

```bash
# Navigate to database service
cd services/database

# Check migration status
npm run migrate:status

# Run pending migrations
npm run migrate:up

# Create new migration
npm run migrate:new <migration_name>
```

### Development Server

```bash
# Start the main server (requires database setup)
cd services/server && npm start

# Start monitor service
npm run monitor:start
```

## Architecture

### Core Verification Flow

1. **Validation**: `SolidityMetadataContract` validates source files and fetches missing sources from IPFS
2. **Compilation**: `SolidityCompilation`/`VyperCompilation` compile contracts using appropriate compilers
3. **Verification**: `Verification` class compares compiled bytecode with on-chain bytecode using `SourcifyChain`

### Database Architecture

- Based on Verifier Alliance database schema with Sourcify-specific extensions
- Key tables: `verified_contracts`, `contract_deployments`, `sourcify_matches`, `compiled_contracts`
- Uses dbmate for migrations and schema management
- Supports both full and partial verification matches

**The authoritative schema is the committed dump at [`services/database/sourcify-database.sql`](services/database/sourcify-database.sql).** Read it to answer schema questions instead of querying a live database. dbmate regenerates it on `npm run migrate:up`, and it must be committed alongside any new migration (see [`services/database/README.md`](services/database/README.md)).

**Never hand-edit `sourcify-database.sql` — always regenerate it with dbmate.** The `validate-database-schema` CI job applies all migrations to a clean postgres, dumps it, and diffs (comment/blank-line-normalized) against the committed file; pg_dump's object ordering is non-obvious (e.g. constraints sort by constraint name, not table name), so hand-edits get the ordering wrong and fail CI. The regeneration recipe (throwaway `postgres:15` container + `DBMATE_SCHEMA_FILE`) is in [`services/database/README.md`](services/database/README.md) under "Adding a new migration"; pg_dump must be version 15 to match CI (pgdg `postgresql-client-15`), not 17.

How the tables join:

- `sourcify_matches.verified_contract_id` → `verified_contracts.id` (Sourcify-specific match info: `creation_match`/`runtime_match` quality, `chain_id`, and the contract's `metadata`)
- `verified_contracts.compilation_id` → `compiled_contracts.id`, and `verified_contracts.deployment_id` → `contract_deployments.id`
- `compiled_contracts_sources` (`compilation_id`, `path`, `source_hash`) is the source set stored for a compilation; join `source_hash` → `sources.source_hash` for the actual content
- `compiled_contracts_metadata.compilation_id` → `compiled_contracts.id`: one metadata blob per compilation (`sourcify_matches.metadata` is kept only until reads switch over, #2924)
- `code` holds bytecode, referenced via `creation_code_hash`/`runtime_code_hash` by both `compiled_contracts` (compiled) and `contracts` (onchain); reach the latter through `contract_deployments.contract_id` → `contracts.id`

### Storage Services

The server supports multiple storage backends:

- `SourcifyDatabase`: PostgreSQL database (primary for API v2)
- `RepositoryV1`: Legacy filesystem storage (deprecated)
- `RepositoryV2`: IPFS-compatible filesystem storage
- `AllianceDatabase`: Verifier Alliance database integration
- `TurboRepository`: write-only Arweave storage through Turbo (off by default)

### Chain Configuration

- Chain support defined in `services/server/src/sourcify-chains-default.json`
- Supports authenticated RPCs, Etherscan APIs, and trace/debug APIs for factory contracts

### API Structure

- **v2 API**: Modern endpoints under `/v2` (requires database backend)
  - Contract lookup: `/v2/contracts`, `/v2/contract/`
  - Verification: `/v2/verify`
  - Job lookup: `/v2/verify`
- **Private API**: Authenticated admin endpoints under `/private` (gated by config; not for public use)
  - Deprecated verification: `/private/verify-deprecated`
  - Contract replacement: `/private/replace-contract`
  - Log level: `/private/change-log-level`
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation available at runtime at `/api-docs/swagger.json`

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Local Development

1. Run `npm install` from project root
2. Build packages: `npx lerna run build`
3. Set up PostgreSQL database (see services/database/README.md)
4. Run database migrations
5. Configure environment variables in services/server/.env
6. Start server: `cd services/server && npm start`

### Database Schema Changes

- For Sourcify-specific changes: Add migration in `services/database/migrations/`
- For Verifier Alliance changes: Update submodule in `services/database/database-specs/`
- Every PR that adds a migration must add a file `.release-todos/<pr-number>-<short-name>.md`. The same applies to any manual step around a production deploy (load balancer, Cloud Run settings, secrets, follow-up scripts). Format and examples: `.release-todos/README.md`. The release script shows these files and deletes them.

### API and Documentation Maintenance

Whenever API response fields are added or removed (especially those defined in `FIELDS_TO_STORED_PROPERTIES` in `services/server/src/utils/database-util.ts`), you **must** also:

- Update the OpenAPI/Swagger spec (`services/server/src/apiv2.yaml`) to reflect the new or removed fields, including the **Available fields** section of any affected endpoint description and the `fields` query parameter description
- Update any relevant README or documentation files that reference the API fields

The `FIELDS_TO_STORED_PROPERTIES` map is the authoritative source used by the validation middleware, so the Swagger docs and READMEs must stay in sync with it.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests with database setup
- Chain tests for multi-blockchain compatibility

## Key Configuration Files

- `services/server/src/config/local.js`: Local server configuration
- `services/server/src/sourcify-chains-default.json`: Supported blockchain networks
- `services/server/.env`: Environment variables

## Server-Specific Architecture

### Service Layer

- **VerificationService**: Core verification orchestrator using worker pools (Piscina)
- **StorageService**: Manages multiple storage backends (database, filesystem, S3)
- **Services class**: Dependency injection container for all services

### Worker Architecture

- Verification runs in isolated worker processes
- `verificationWorker.ts`: Handles individual verification jobs
- Configurable concurrency and worker idle timeout

### Request Flow

1. **API Layer**: Express routes with OpenAPI validation
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration
3. **Worker Layer**: Isolated verification processing
4. **Storage Layer**: Persistence to configured backends

## Automated Review Guidelines

When reviewing PRs as an automated agent:

- Check database migration safety (services/database/) — flag destructive operations
- Flag a PR that adds a migration or needs a manual deploy step but adds no `.release-todos/` file
- Verify API changes maintain backwards compatibility for the v2 endpoints
- Check that changes to packages/ don't break dependent services (server, monitor)
- Verify the OpenAPI/Swagger spec (`apiv2.yaml`) is updated if API endpoints or response fields change — including the **Available fields** section and the `fields` query parameter description
- Flag any hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API keys
- For verification flow changes, ensure both full and partial match paths are covered

### Posting review comments as pending (not submitted)

When reviewing a PR, always post findings as **unsubmitted comments** — i.e. GitHub _pending_ review comments, queued for the human to read/edit/submit. Only submit the review when the user explicitly tells you to; otherwise leave it pending. First look for an already-open pending review on the PR and append to it; if there is none, create a new pending review.

The GitHub remote for `gh` commands is `argotorg/sourcify` (the local default branch is `staging`).

Details for adding such inline comments:

- Inline comments must anchor on a line that is **part of the PR diff** (an added line, or a context line within a hunk). Commenting on an unchanged line outside any hunk fails. Verify with `gh pr diff <n> --repo argotorg/sourcify`.
- A user can have only **one pending review per PR**. `POST /repos/argotorg/sourcify/pulls/<n>/reviews` with no `event` field creates a pending review, but it returns `422 "User can only have one pending review per pull request"` if one already exists.
- To **append** comments to an existing pending review (REST has no append endpoint), find the pending review's GraphQL node id and use the `addPullRequestReviewThread` mutation:

  ```bash
  # find the pending review node_id (state == PENDING)
  gh api /repos/argotorg/sourcify/pulls/<n>/reviews --jq '.[] | select(.state=="PENDING") | .node_id'

  # append one inline thread (single line: pass line + side; multi-line: add startLine + startSide)
  gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($reviewId: ID!, $body: String!, $path: String!, $line: Int!) {
    addPullRequestReviewThread(input: {
      pullRequestReviewId: $reviewId, body: $body, path: $path, line: $line, side: RIGHT
    }) { thread { id } }
  }' -f reviewId="$REVIEW_ID" -f body="$BODY" -f path="<path>" -F line=<line>
  ```

- Do **not** submit the review (no `submitPullRequestReview` / no `event: APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|COMMENT`) unless explicitly asked — leave it pending.
- Before producing a findings list, fetch the existing pending comments and de-duplicate against them so you don't re-report what's already queued.

## Git Workflow Rules

### After a PR is merged, always create a fresh branch

Never push additional commits to a branch whose PR was already merged. Always create a fresh branch from the base branch for follow-up work:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b <new-descriptive-branch> origin/staging
```

## Pull Request Conventions

### Do not add a "Test plan" section to PR descriptions

When opening PRs, omit the default "Test plan" / "## Test plan" checklist section. Keep the body to Summary (and Why / Notes / context as relevant). Testing is tracked elsewhere; the checklist is noise in this repo.
